This weeks assignment was another troubling one for me, but not because I intentionally went over my head. When the homework was demonstrated in class last Saturday, I saw buttons that had to be chosen. My mind intuitively jumped to using forms for them, without ever considering another option. It turns out, out of everyone I spoke to, I was the only one to attempt to utilize forms for this. This unfortunately led me to problems that I weren't able to solve in time, though I made a nice discovery near the end of it. 

What I'm turning in is each individual field of buttons having their own unique forms, rather than everything being in one single form. This made grabbing the values of each question much more convoluted then I had planned, and I wasn't quite able to figure out the solution to it. So no matter what's chosen or left blank for the buttons, it only registers it for the first set of answers. 

I was also unable to callback to the onclick function when the timer reaches 0, so the timer goes into the negatives rather than activating said function and increasing the unanswered variable. 

I don't feel so bad about messing this up because I unintentionally did something more complex, rather than purposefully trying to be slick and coming up short. I should be able to correct this once I figure out how to appropriately set up the right methods for getting everything into one form.
